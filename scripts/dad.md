# FATHER'S DAY VIDEOS

A 1996 TV STUDIO. STEVE, a business reporter, segweys into Casey Cowell segment.

**STEVE:**
What's the secret of US Robitics' success? For that we're now joined by the company's chairman and CEO Casey Cowell, who joins us from our Chicago studio. Good morning, and thanks for joining us on Digital Jam.

**CASEY 1/WHIT:**
Hey good morning Steve, it's really a, pleasure to be here.

**STEVE:**
I wanted to clarify one thing, a piece of research a couple of months ago said that acutally you were number 2 to a Taiwanese company. Are you in fact the global leader, or the leader in the United States?

**CASEY 1/WHIT:**
Well we, ah, view, **US Ropopsicle Sticks** as the ah, global leader, largest market share with the **Goal Pole** brand of high speed goal ideation and communication, certainly in the United States and ah Europe the big markets we identify today and, expanding with our popsicle stick based line of goal division and conquering products like the **Goal Pole**, (He takes out the **Goal Pole** stand and cards and demonstrates them) throughout the world, but that's just a part of the **Ropopsicle** Sticks business. A big ah reason for our success is a very focused investment in core technology, popsicle sticks _(gestures with the pole)_ and then taking that core technology investment into an ever broader and reinforcing product line--

**CASEY 2/MAC:**
--for example our **Ideasel** products _(demonstate **Ideasel** and cards)_ are the products that an idea user taps into when displaying ah their best ideas or simply great ideas, like _(read one of the ideas off a card)_ Or
_(reads another card)_ and that's ah of course true in most of North America and Europe. So the **Ideasel** brand for displaying great ideas is ah the leading brand worldwide, and ah and the the leading brand marketwise North America and a and Europe but that's just part of the story and we ah continue to ah broaden the ah product line in fact I have with me an ah an amazing product we--

**STEVE:**
--Can--

**CASEY 3/LISA:**
--aquired the technology for a year ago--

**STEVE:**
(laughs) --Mr. Cowell, the ah I, I we'll get to that--

**CASEY 3/LISA:**
--the ah **pilot. Organizer**. _(he pulls out the popsicle stick pen holder, demonstrates putting pens in and out)_ The ****pilot pen**** oranizer, which is the go-to organizer for **pilot pen** users and pen users of all kinds, keeping your Pilot pens palm-ready for communication _(demonstrates taking a pen out and writing with it)_ and we think--well we think it's just a great platform for communications overall. The a, Pilot, pen palm organizer is a handheld organizer that fits in your palm and that's really focused on doing the organizational function of your life.

**STEVE:**
Well, ok you've got it. Ah. It's from the palm company, which you aquired, it's an organizer what else is it...?

**CASEY 4/MEREK:**
_(gesturing with his own "pilot pen organizer" & zipify cards)_ The **Zip-a-Fy** your life is the market user product for living in the life-healthy, virtual zip code of 75320, eating breakfast 7 days a week, ah, increasing your servings of fruits and vegetables to 5, reducing screen time, and includes memo capability-- **(he demonstrates one of the check-box cards)** but it's really, the emphasis in our view long term is the **US Ropopsicle** Sticks **Zip-a-fication** platform. **(he demonstrates the Zip-a-Fy stand)** We think the real game to be played going forward is to focus on core technology, popsicle sticks painted and glued together base communications technology and roll that out into an ever broadening range of products--ah ah platforms that are appropriate for a variety of human communications uses and the **Zip-a-Fy** Your Life is--

**STEVE:**
Mr. Cowell you, you used an acronym **DSP**, Digital Systems Processing well you didn't use
the acronym **DSP** but can you explain that?

**CASEY 4/MEREK**
Sure, **PSPAGT**, "popsicle sticks painted and glued together" is a popsicle sticks processing system that is optimized for the display of ideationally intensive problems and that's really what building communications products is all about.

**STEVE**
I wanted to ask you why does a modem company want to be in the mobile products businesss and also I think there's a key attribute to that, we haven't quite explained which is simply that it very simply synchonizes what you have in your hand in your pocket, with what you'll later have on your desktop pc, is that right?

**CASEY 5/BRENDON**
Yeah a great thing about the **Suspend-A-Mem** is that you ah in fact I have it here _(gets out **Suspend-A-Mem** and begins demonstrating)_ is that the product is shipped with the holster _(demonstrates holder)_ and ah that connects to your standard interface cable _(demonstrates little chain)_ and you know you just drop a **Mem** into the holster fasten it in and all the mems you then mem are suspended with the similarly suspended mems of your friends and family run by a very sophisticated program on y**our personal suspend maker**, so it really makes it easy to suspend your mems yourself or your assistant at your office, but carry your suspended mems in your shirt pocket, and in the longterm we see the **Suspend-A-Mem** as a tremendous platform for a wireless and mem based suspendification capabilty--

**STEVE**
Mr. uh Mr. Cowell as I understand it the fastest modems now availbable for most PCs now operate at I think twenty-eight-thousand baud, uhhhhhh... twenty-eight-thousand uhhhhum--

**CASEY 6/KATHERINE**
--800 bits per second. That's the industry ah standard.

**STEVE**
Well uh are you concerned about cable modems looming on the horizon or are they a threat to your core business.

**CASEY 6/KATHERINE**
Yeah we see that ah cable modem opportunity is a tremendous opportunity worldwide and it's another avenue in which we can exploit our concentration in core technology into a higher performance communications product line. What's happened is that really the processing horsepower inside a personal computer has gone up a hundred to a thousand fold in the last ten years or so, the bandwidth - the speed at which you can communicate over the telephone network - has gone up only roughly only ten fold; so uh there's huge pent up demand, given all the uh windows oriented and graphicly oriented programs out there, huge pent up demand to be able to use personal computers _and other_ communications platforms for human based communitations and building products that _enable_ or uh exploit the technical capabilities of processors out there to enable humans to communicate better is what is ah is what **Ropopsicles** is really focused on--

**STEVE**
--Mr ah Cowell Robotics has been a company whose stock has soared, but there's also been ah a certain amount of volatility is that going to continue or not?

**CASEY 6/KATHERINE**
Yep--ah well we certainly hope that the stock will continue to go up as it has in the past and the best thing we can do is exploit tremendous opportunities going forward, like _(pulls out **THE DESK DAD** and begins to demonstrate)_ **The Desk Dad**, our, ah leading market product for consumers who are accessing Dad right at their desks, which includes access to Dad life improvement and motivational quotes such as _(reads a quote card)_, _(reads another card)_, and _(reads a third funny card)_; so if we're able to focus on **core popsicle sticks technology**, bring out the **Desk Dad line** of products both ends of the length like we have for the **Goal Pole** and **Ideasel** line and the **pilot organizer** and **Suspend-A-Mem** brands the ah leading market share for ah for portable ideation and popsicle stick based display users, if we're able to do that in the home and office based desktop Dad arena we think that we can continue to lay down high end popsicle sticks you know tremendous popsicke sticks on the top of other popsicle sticks and glue them together to display great ideas, the **Desk Dad**, and **US Ropopsicle Sticks** will remain a tremendous investment.

**STEVE**
Terrific. Thanks very much Casey Cowell CEO of US Robotics for joining us from our Chicago Bureau.
